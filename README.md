## Overview

So, hey there!

This is Challenge 3 (Hard Challenge) of the Topcoder Data Science
Skill Builder Challenge. This is the third and final challenge of the Skill Builder Exercise

By now, you would have noticed that all three challenges (easy, medium and hard) are related and inter-connected in some way.

## Installing Pandas

Now, you want to install Pandas on your local machine

Next, open your command-line (or Terminal) and type the following command

`python -m pip install pandas`

As per usual, this command would install a few Python packages and dependencies, so exercise some patience as this may take a few minutes, depending on the specs of your local machine.

## Running Jupyter Notebooks

There are two ways to run Jupyter Notebooks on your local machine and you can do that by either running in directly in Visual Studio Code or in your favorite browser (I'm using Microsoft Edge). Bear in mind that running Jupyter Notebooks from inside VS Code is very tricky and you can break a lot of things in the process, so I'd advise you to run in your browser using the following command in command-line (or Terminal)

`jupyter notebook`

## Setting Up

Now that your Jupyter Notebook is running in your favorite browser, navigate to the directory where you want to place all your dev files.

For me, mine is at

"C:\Users\Dexter\jupyter-proj\tc-data-science-skillbuilder-challenge\tc-hard-challenge"

Please bear in mind that yours will not look exactly like mine, so no need to get scared.

Moving on, create a new Jupyter Notebook file in this directory and call it "hard-challenge.ipynb"

Next, while on your browser screen where you can see all files, move your cursor to the top right corner and click on "Upload". This step is very important as you will need to use it to upload your dataset to the Jupyter Notebook directory you're working in.

Next, navigate to where your dataset was downloaded... Mine is my Downloads folder and it is named "sample-iris.csv".

Once it's done uploading to the working directory, go now to your "hard-challenge.ipynb" file as this is where your code will go in

## Finished

You're done... Now you can take my source code in this repo and give this third and final challenge a shot...
